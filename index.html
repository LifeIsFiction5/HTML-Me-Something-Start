            </h2>
               <p>What's funny is I started with HTML coding in a "Computer Class" I took back in my sophomore year of High School. I remember sweat drying on my back after coming in from 100 degree California afternoons while I cut my teeth on Hello world projects.  I remember the thrill of putting my first image into the code, a logo of Redlands High School's Terrier.</p>

            <i>This is all it was.  One little picture but it made me excited to know I put it there.  One little low resolution logo occupying what was once blank space.</i>
         </p>
         <p>  I felt like I was tapping into some forbidden knowledge, even though I was at the very lowest level of coding at the time.  It's really nostalgic to be back at it again.</p>
         <p>Now, here I am years and years later re-learning what I'd known.</p>

         <p>Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I had pulled that thread and found what had really interested me about HTML coding and coding in general.  Now, instead of thinking about what could have been, I've  been focusing on making my life follow those interests.</p>
         <p>Of course, Launch Code isn't the first time I had followed my interests, I have been an actor in short films and Music videos, the biggest of which being for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fAy0yV5OU">Jelly Roll</a> through Strange Music, although my favorite was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJHv5Xj2IeU">This one, because I got to work with a big pig named Kevin.</a>  I fed him Cheerios all day to keep him where we wanted him during the shoot!

         I have also worked with Monday Night Football at Arrowhead stadium several times as a member of the <a href="https://www.wsn.com/nfl/skycam-ultimate-guide/">Wildcat Skycam Team.</a></p>
         <p> I want to learn to code, not just because it could make me $, &cent;, &pound;, or &yen;, but because I want to recapture that feeling of doing magic, of feeling like I'm alchemicalizing my thoughts into digital substance.  I really like this process, and it's given me a lot of hope in moving forward in life.  I've always felt like I was supposed to be in some sort of tech or digital industry, and this has given me a path forward in doing so.  It may take sleepless nights, cancelled plans, lost friends, but I don't care.  This is my future, and I will build it one line of code at a time.</p>
