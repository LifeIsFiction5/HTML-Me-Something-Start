            </h3>
               <p>What's funny is I started with HTML coding in a "Computer Class" I took back in my sophomore year of High School. I remember sweat drying on my back after coming in from 100 degree California afternoons while I cut my teeth on Hello world projects.  I think of that feeling when I code now, the darkness of the room and the blaring West Coast sun streaking into the classroom through the tall windows.  Much of the light was blocked out.  The lights, all doused.  The glow of screens illuminated the faces of my classmates in the computer lab.
               </p>
               <p>We had just created our first simple HTML web page.  I remember the thrill of putting my first image into the notepad file: a logo of Redlands High School's Terrier.</p>

                  </a>
               </p>
         <p style="text-align:center">
            <i>This is all it was.  One little picture, but it made me excited to know that I put it there just using a notepad file.  One poorly drawn, low resolution logo occupying what was once blank space.</i>
         </p>
         <p>  I felt like I was tapping into some forbidden knowledge, even though I was at the very lowest level of coding at the time.  It's really nostalgic to be back at it again.  But I drifted in interests.  Found my way to the A/V club where I focused on creating video and audio content.  I got trained in Final Cut Pro 7, and soon was king of the geeks: The president of Redlands High School's "Digital Dogs", where we created a weekly show.  It was fun, and it led to me doing a lot more work in video content, but ultimately, I was drawn back to coding.</p>
         <p>Now, here I am years and years later re-learning what I'd known before, getting just as excited by putting images onto the screen, just with better understanding and more sophisticated tools to do so.</p>

         </p>
         <p style="text-align: center">
            <i>In trying to learn these new skills, I think of these two, my grandparents.  Two of the finest people  I have ever known.  They told me  I could do anything I put my mind to, and while I don't believe that about myself, the feeling of trust I have in them is so much stronger than my self doubt.</i>
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I had pulled that thread and found what had really interested me about HTML coding and coding in general.  Now, instead of thinking about what could have been, I've  been focusing on making my life follow those interests.</p>
         <p>Of course, Launch Code isn't the first time I had followed my interests, I have produced numerous video projects for commercials and short films behind the camera.  For a brief while, I even made money by doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfnl2es6ak&t=181s">wedding videography.</a> I have been an actor in short films and Music videos, the biggest of which being for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fAy0yV5OU">Jelly Roll</a> through Strange Music, although my favorite was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJHv5Xj2IeU">This one, because I got to work with a big pig named Kevin.</a>  I fed him Cheerios all day to keep him where we wanted him during the shoot!

         I have also worked with Monday Night Football at Arrowhead stadium several times as a member of the <a href="https://www.wsn.com/nfl/skycam-ultimate-guide/">Wildcat Skycam Team.
         </a>  There are incrdible people on the Monday Night Football team and I was honored to be a local utility crew for them.  I don't care much for football, but I really enjoyed being able to go all over Arrowhead stadium and get behind the scenes!

         <p style="text-align: center;"><i>This is the sort of camera that we would fly around Arrowhead.</i></p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">
            <strong>But I could never get those dimly lit classrooms with the blinking cursor out of my head.  Coding was an elusive secret I wanted to solve, a club I was dying to be a part of.</strong>
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;"> I want to learn to code, not just because it could make me $, &cent;, &pound;, or &yen;, but because I want to recapture that feeling of doing magic, of feeling like I'm alchemicalizing my thoughts into digital substance.  I really like this process, and it's given me a lot of hope in moving forward in life.  I've always felt like I was supposed to be in some sort of tech or digital industry, and this has given me a path forward in doing so.  It may take sleepless nights, cancelled plans, lost friends, but I don't care.  I want this to be my future.  I want to build it one line at a time.</p>
